# Python Practice Repository

This repository contains small Python scripts I write while learning and mastering Python.  
Each script focuses on a specific concept — such as loops, functions, conditionals, data structures, or simple algorithms.

All scripts include clear in-code comments to help explain what each section does, making the repository useful both for my own reference and for anyone else learning Python.
